[TOLO](https://take-one-leave-one.herokuapp.com) is a full-stack web application that allows strangers to anonymously send and receive positive messages in a one-to-one exchange. Users write messages for strangers, and receive messages in return, which they can upvote, downvote, delete, or pass on to others. 

## Live App ‚ö°Ô∏è
